Japan is an archipelago, or string of islands, on the eastern edge of Asia.<br>
There are four main islands: Hokkaido, Honshu, Shikoku, and Kyushu.<br>
There are also nearly 4,000 smaller islands! Japan's nearest mainland neighbors are the Siberian region of Russia in the north and Korea and China farther south.<br>
Almost four-fifths of Japan is covered with mountains.<br>
The Japanese Alps run down the center of the largest island, Honshu.<br>
The highest peak is Mount Fuji, a cone-shaped volcano considered sacred by many Japanese.<br>
Japan can be a dangerous place. Three of the tectonic plates that form Earth's crust meet nearby and often move against each other, causing earthquakes.<br>
More than a thousand earthquakes hit Japan every year. Japan also has about 200 volcanoes, 60 of which are active.</i><br></font></p></left>

 <p><font face='Chaucer'size=4><i>The Japanese are famous for their willingness to work very hard.<br>
Children are taught to show respect for others, especially parents and bosses.<br>
They learn to do what's best for their family or company and worry less about their own needs.<br>
Japanese food is very different from food in Western countries.<br>
There is lots of rice, fish, and vegetables, but little meat.<br>
With little fat or dairy, this diet is very healthy, which helps Japanese people live, on average, longer than any other people in the world.<br>
<b>Religion</b><br>
Religion in Japan is a wonderful mish-mash of ideas from Shintoism and Buddhism.<br>
Unlike in the West, religion in Japan is rarely preached, nor is it a doctrine.<br>
Instead it is a moral code, a way of living, almost indistinguishable from Japanese social and cultural values.<br>
Japanese religion is also a private, family affair.<br>
It is separate from the state; there are no religious prayers or symbols in a school graduation ceremony, for example.<br>
Religion is rarely discussed in every day life and the majority of Japanese do not worship regularly or claim to be religious.<br>
However, most people turn to religious rituals in birth, marriage and death and take part in spiritual matsuri (or festivals) throughout the year.<br>
<b>Manga and Anime</b><br>
Once almost completely unknown to the world outside Japan, manga (Japanese comics) and anime (Japanese animation)<br> 
have become a global phenomenon - and their popularity is growing every day.<br>
Manga books are generally printed in black and white and cover a wide variety of genres and subject matter aimed at both sexes and all ages, not just for young boys - to whom comics are generally marketed in the West.<br>
Themes include romance, action adventure, science fiction, comedy, sports and can also venture into darker subject matter for adults such as horror and more risqué material;<br>
though the latter tends not to be acknowledged in everyday life and culture.<br>
As it makes up a large section of Japan's publishing industry, manga books can be found and seen everywhere.<br>
People reading manga on trains during rush hour is a common sight in Tokyo as well as the rest of the country.<br>
Every town will have a book store with aisles upon aisles of different manga genres and larger cities even have stores entirely dedicated to the medium over multiple storeys.<br>
Convenience stores are quite happy for patrons to stand and read manga even if they are not going to buy and many waiting rooms and restaurants have bookshelves with popular serialisations.<br>
Once certain manga have proven their worth by popularity, the natural progression is for an animated TV series to be created, however, manga is not the only source of inspiration for anime.<br>
For example, Pokémon was a worldwide hit as a video game for Nintendo before it was made into manga and anime series.<br>
The obvious differences from manga such as colour, movement and sound bring anime to life, but there is one additional element which is extremely important: the theme song.<br>
Artists from the J-pop and J-rock world are all falling over themselves to write the theme songs for the next big anime series as it is almost a guaranteed hit and provides great exposure.<br>
The anticipation of which artist it will be can often overshadow the anime itself, being the topic of hot discussion in school playgrounds and internet forums.<br>
Most visitors to Japan simply skim the surface of manga and anime by visually appreciating the characters which pop up wherever you go with no real knowledge of who they are.<br>
However, a little research into this fantasy world can enrich your time in Japan as your knowledge of characters<br>
will create instant common ground with Japanese people you may meet and you will find yourself actively searching for and spotting the characters you know.<br>
Spring in Japan can only mean one thing: cherry blossom.<br>
Sandwiched between the long, bitter winter months and the sweltering humidity of summer, spring is by far the most popular time for tourism in Japan - both domestic and international.<br>
The atmosphere at this time of year is infectious, with parks packed with revelers and supermarket shelves stacked with the latest blossom-flavoured snacks and drinks.<br>
The cherry blossom (or sakura) "front" sweeps along the length of the country each year, beginning with Okinawa in the far south in February and working its way along Japan to northern Hokkaido in May.<br>
A variety of factors can affect when the cherry blossom comes into bloom: a particularly cold winter can mean that the flowers come out late, unseasonably mild weather can usher them out sooner,<br>
and heavy rain can mean that the trees drop their petals much quicker than otherwise.<br>
For this reason, the forecast is followed avidly throughout the sakura season!<br></font></i></p></right>

The Japanese people have a deep affection for the beauty of the landscape.<br>
The ancient Shinto religion says natural features like mountains, waterfalls, and forests have their own spirits, like souls.<br>
Most of Japan is covered by countryside. But with more than 100 million people living in such a small place, wildlife has suffered.<br>
Pollution is now tightly controlled, but road building and other human activities have harmed natural habitats.<br>
About 136 species in Japan are listed as endangered.<br>
The warm Tsushima Current flows from the south into the Sea of Japan, where it meets a colder current from the north.<br>
The mixing of waters makes the seas around Japan very rich in fish and other sea life.<br></font></i></p></left>

Japan is the only country in the world with a reigning emperor.<br>
Emperors have no real power, but they are still revered as a symbol of the country's traditions and unity.<br>
World War II devastated Japan's economy.<br>
But the Japanese people's hard work and clever innovation turned it around, making it the second largest economy in the world.<br>
Japan's high-tech industry makes some of the most popular electronic products in the world.<br>
Japan’s system of economic management is probably without parallel in the world.<br>
Though the extent of direct state participation in economic activities is limited, the government’s control and influence over business is stronger and more pervasive than in most other countries with market economies.<br>
This control is exercised primarily through the government’s constant consultation with business and through the authorities’ deep indirect involvement in banking.<br>
Japan’s economic freedom score is 74.1, making its economy the 23rd freest in the 2021 Index.<br>
Its overall score has increased by 0.8 point, primarily because of an improvement in fiscal health.<br>
Japan is ranked 6th among 40 countries in the Asia–Pacific region, and its overall score is above the regional and world averages.<br></font></i></p></left>

People first came to Japan about 30,000 years ago.<br>
At the time, the main islands were connected to Siberia and Korea by bridges of dry land, so people crossed on foot.<br>
The first society, called the Jomon culture, arose about 12,000 years ago.<br>
Around the same time, the Ainu people arrived by boat from Siberia.<br>
The Jomon and Ainu survived for thousands of years, hunting, fishing, and gathering plants.<br>
In 300 B.C., the Yayoi people came to Honshu Island from Korea and China.<br>
They were skilled weavers, tool makers, and farmers who began cultivating rice in flooded paddy fields.<br>
In 660 B.C., Japan's first emperor, Jimmu Tenno, came to power.<br>
Emperors controlled Japan until the 12th century A.D., when military rulers, called shoguns, took control and ruled by might.<br>
Europeans first arrived in Japan in 1543, bringing guns and Christianity.<br>
In 1635, the ruling shogun closed Japan to foreigners and forbade Japanese to travel abroad.<br>
This isolation lasted more than 200 years. In 1868, the shoguns were overthrown and emperors returned.<br>
This was a time of great change and modernization for Japan.<br>
During World War I (1914-1917), Japan fought on the side of the U.S.<br>
But on December 7, 1941, Japan bombed the United States navy fleet at Pearl Harbor in Hawaii and the U.S. entered World War II.<br>
From 1941-1945, Japan's military leaders fought against the U.S. and the allied forces.<br>
In August 1945, the U.S. dropped atomic bombs on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, killing about 115,000 people.<br>
Japan surrendered a few days later.<br></font></i></p></left>
