<font face='times new roman' color='black'><h2><b>What is the Country Japan?</h3></b>
<font face='times new roman' size=4><i>- Japan (Japanese: 日本, Nippon or Nihon,is an island country in East Asia, located in the northwest Pacific Ocean. It is bordered on the west by the Sea of Japan, and extends from the Sea of Okhotsk in the north toward the East China Sea and Taiwan in the south.<br>
Part of the Ring of Fire, Japan spans an archipelago of 6852 islands covering 377,975 square kilometers (145,937 sq mi); the five main islands are Hokkaido, Honshu, Shikoku, Kyushu, and Okinawa.<br>
Tokyo is Japan's capital and largest city; other major cities include Yokohama, Osaka, Nagoya, Sapporo, Fukuoka, Kobe, and Kyoto.<br>
Japan is the eleventh-most populous country in the world, as well as one of the most densely populated and urbanized.<br>
About three-fourths of the country's terrain is mountainous, concentrating its population of 125.36 million on narrow coastal plains.<br>
Japan is divided into 47 administrative prefectures and eight traditional regions.<br>
The Greater Tokyo Area is the most populous metropolitan area in the world, with more than 37.4 million residents.<br></i></b></font>
<font face='times new roman'><h2><b>What makes Japan Great?</font></h2></b>
<font face='times new roman' size=4><i>- Japan’s architecture, art, traditions, crafts. Also, its worldwide known pop culture (including manga, anime, and video games).<br>
It’s something that definitely only Japan can offer. No other country contains the same characteristics.<br>
<br>The food is something we cannot put aside! Who doesn’t love Japanese food? Ramen, sushi, udon, yakiniku, okonomiyaki, takoyaki, and many more!! The food is amazing! And the best part is that depending on where you go it will always have a different taste.<br>
Many regions in Japan have their own style of cuisine, and a plate that they’re known for, which only makes more interesting! Another thing that is great, is that you don’t have to spend a fortune on these foods, most restaurants will cost between $5-$10 for one meal.<br>
Unless you go to a very prestigious place, most of the foods will be affordable.<br>
So, if you come to Japan don’t forget to try as much food as you can!<br>
<br>Something that surprises most people when they first arrive to Japan is how polite people are.<br>
Japanese people tend to be always really nice even if they’re not having the best day.<br>
Always helping people when they are in need, like giving directions, and sometimes even taking the person to the place they want to go to when they might have a prior engagement.<br>
People always follow the rules and maintain order anywhere they go. Keeping the city very safe and clean 99% of the time.<br>
It’s something that you definitely don’t see everywhere you go, making Japan even more unique in that sense.<br>
Sometimes, it might even be a bit difficult to follow as a foreigner since there are a lot of unspoken rules that Japanese follow each day.<br>
However, they are always very understanding and will help you out if you are ever in need of help.<br>
<font face='times new roman'><h2><b>Why travel to Japan?</font></h2></b>
-It’s easy to get around on public transportation<br><br>
Japan has one of the most efficient and reliable public transport systems in the world, with a wide range of travel options including bus, train, and subway services across the country.
One of the best ways to get between cities is to ride the Shinkansen bullet trains, which can reach a speed of up to 300 km/h and boast a range of luxury services onboard.<br>
The most cost-efficient way to travel by Shinkansen is to buy a JR Pass online before traveling to Japan.<br>
<br>Japan is very clean<br>
The Japanese really pride themselves on their cleanliness, and upon first arrival in the country you may be surprised by how sparkling clean the streets are.<br>
Hotels and restaurants tend to be absolutely spotless, filled with pleasant smells, and regularly and efficiently cleaned.<br>
One downside is that there tends to be a total absence of trash cans in public spaces.<br>
However, you can just follow the Japanese example and carry garbage with you until you find a place to get rid of it later on.<br>
<br>The incredible natural landscapes<br>
Although Japan is perhaps best known internationally for its technologically advanced cities, the majority of the country is actually taken up by a vast expanse of forested hills and mountains, and there is lots of nature to explore.<br>
One of the most obvious beauty spots to visit is the iconic Mount Fuji, but you shouldn’t rule out a visit to lesser known natural gems such as the Arashiyama bamboo forest or the Ritsurin landscape gardens on Shikoku Island.<br></font>
